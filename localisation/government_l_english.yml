 noble_captains_reform:0 "Noble Captians"
 noble_captains_reform_desc:0 "A great seafaring culture exists amongst the Nobility. Many of them are skilled commanders possessing their own private fleets.

 expand_fortifications_reform:0 "Expand Fortifications"
 expand_fortifications_reform_desc:0 "Our land has many easily fortified areas and these are essentially impenetrable to our enemies.

 charter_of_property_rights_reform:0 "Charter of Property Rights"
 charter_of_property_rights_reform_desc:0 "At the pressing of the powerful merchant class the state has codified an inherited right to own property through the male line. This empowered the individual in a manner which perhaps the merchants had not originally intended. Some of the peasantry is becoming landed and the Nobility is furious. On the positive side everyone is extremely wealthy and productivity is through the roof. Perhaps rights are a good thing."
 ceremonial_monarch_reform:0 "Ceremonial Monarch"
 ceremonial_monarch_reform_desc:0 "The Monarchy is purely ceremonial and has no power at all. The government controls what they say and do and where they go. This is very useful from a diplomatic perspective as the Monarch is an excellent prop to bring out when needed and the strict control of their life ensures that the gaffes that regularly plague foreign Royalty are not common here. The rulers are in far better health and have more time on their hands. For some reason this has led to them having far more children."
