## EU4 AUSTRALIA MULTIPLAYER MOD
This mod is used in the EU4 Australia discord community, and removes the most egregious vanilla imbalances, and adds our own changes :)

# Usage
To begin using the git repo, a good starting point are the github instructions here:
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

To get started using the git command line (eg. Git Bash), the following commands are your friends, in rough order of intended usage:  

Create a branch, which you can add your changes to, and set it to track the GitHub repo
>git push --set-upstream origin *BranchName*  


 Stage a file to git tracking (eg. if you create a new file, or make changes). 
>git add *Filename*


 Commits changes you've added above to git tracking; Until you commit no changes are actually recorded, and they can be lost
>git commit -m "*Message*"
 

 Push your local changes to the upstream git repository, making them visible to everyone else
>git push
 

 After a mod update, or merged changes on the upstream repo, you may update your local copy
 >git fetch

After the above process, your changes can be added to the mainline mod, assuming everyone else likes them :D


GU
Have fun modding. I suggest you discuss changes you'd like to make to the main mod beforehand, if you want to be sure your changes are included!
